    "# After that, we delved into the basic structure of Python code and explored\n",
    "# expressions, operators, and variables. We wrote our first multi-line program\n",
    "# and studied several coding principles in Python, such as multiple assignment,\n",
    "# indentation, loops, and output.\n",

    "# ## 3.8.1 Answer the questions\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. **What are the advantages of the Spyder IDE over a simple text editor?**\n",
    "#    - Spyder provides an integrated environment for coding in Python\n",
    "#    - Includes debugging tools, code completion\n",
    "#    - Advanced features not available in simple text editors\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. **How are the operators written in Python?**\n",
    "#    - Addition: `+`\n",
    "#    - Subtraction: `-`\n",
    "#    - Multiplication: `*`\n",
    "#    - Division: `/`\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. **What is the difference between `*` and `**` operators in Python?**\n",
    "#    - `*` is for multiplication\n",
    "#    - `**` is for exponentiation\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4. **What are expressions in Python, and why are they important?**\n",
    "#    - Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators\n",
    "#    - They form basic building blocks of Python programs\n",
    "#    - Allow execution of operations\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. **What is a variable, and how can a value be assigned to it?**\n",
    "#    - A variable is a storage location in memory with a name\n",
    "#    - Assign using `=`, example: `x = 5`\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 6. **Can a variable be named `import` in Python?**\n",
    "#    - No, `import` is a reserved keyword\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 7. **Are `math`, `Math`, and `MATH` equivalent in Python?**\n",
    "#    - No, Python is case-sensitive\n",
    "#    - These are treated as different identifiers\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 8. **How can expressions be grouped in Python?**\n",
    "#    - Using parentheses `()`\n",
    "#    - Controls order of operations\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 9. **Difference between syntactic and semantic error?**\n",
    "#    - Syntactic: violates grammar rules\n",
    "#    - Semantic: runs but produces incorrect results\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 10. **Default values of `sep` and `end` in `print()`?**\n",
    "#     - `sep`: space `' '`\n",
    "#     - `end`: newline `\\\\n`\n",
    "# ## 3.8.2 True or False\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. **Division of even number by 2 returns int?**\n",
    "#    False. Simple division always returns float.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. **String index: positive from 0, negative from -1?**\n",
    "#    True.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. **Python strings are mutable?**\n",
    "#    False. Strings are immutable.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4. **`Dream team` valid variable name?**\n",
    "#    False. Cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. **Can use `lambda` as variable name?**\n",
    "#    False. Reserved keyword.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 6. **Expressions end with period?**\n",
    "#    False. No special end symbol needed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 7. **`a = 25` equals `a == 25`?**\n",
    "#    False. Assignment vs comparison.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 8. **`print()` output differs from expression evaluation?**\n",
    "#    True. Print displays, evaluation computes.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 9. **Semantic errors are syntax errors?**\n",
    "#    False. Different types of errors.\n",
